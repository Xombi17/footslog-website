                  <p>
                    Founded by the Rotaract Club FRCRCE, Footslog began as a passionate initiative to connect urban students with the natural wonders that surround our bustling city. What started as small group expeditions has grown into an annual tradition that draws adventure enthusiasts from across the region.
